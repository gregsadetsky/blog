if you're trying to finish a project and need moral & emotional support over text and as many calls as you need, i will cheerlead the fuck out of your project for a 0.1% equity stake.

my cheerleading is very honest and extreme. i will highlight everything astonishing about you. you will 100000% ship.

within 20 seconds of posting the above to bluesky, someone (who's an extraordinary, incredible person) immediately chimed in: "can confirm greg is best cheerleader". a minute later, another infinitely great person, said: "testé et approuvé" which means the same thing but in french.

first, we meet over a videochat and informally talk about your project. mostly we talk about your goals and what's been tough. getting over a mental hump? logistical hoops (maybe you're shipping an electron app on windows and can't get the X to talk to the Y)?

it's all going to be absolutely ok.

we get a feel for each other. if there's no fit, that's ok too, we part ways and wish each other good luck.

otherwise, we work together. we have each other's numbers. we keep in touch.

there are no set rules.

one core truth is that any interesting work is full of anxiety-inducing unknowns, and that your idea is probably extremely awesome. that's not a blanket statement, i have to see your idea first. but most ideas are - and most ideas that people care about a lot are a lot more awesome than they think.

that's it. i'm not sure how the 0.1% equity comes into play - maybe you sell $10k worth of some product and you give me 0.1% of that which is ten dollars (i.e. you buy me a drink). it's a fair deal. if you make a million, then i get $1000. if you make a billion, then i get $100k. if you invent whatever comes after phones and make a trillion, then i get $100 million and invest it in all of my other friends' projects. let's do this.

the cheerleading is why i do it - i love cheering people on. i love seeing people succeed. i love seeing people ship. i love seeing people do the things they want to do. i love seeing people be happy. i love seeing people do the things they want to do and be happy. i love seeing people do the things they want to do and be happy and succeed.

i also like shining all the light on the things that are working and that are exciting and that are accessible and that are almost right there. you can ship that game. you can bundle that sdk. you can ship a first version now and keep the rest of your ideas for an update. you have done things before. you've gotten up, you are alive. we are all here. humanity has made a lot of stuff and you are an integral, irreplaceable, unique part of this incredible adventure (LIFE!).

all of my advice is corny, and my perspective dumbly true. so many things are so much simpler than we make them out to be.

my cheerleading is not deep. it just works.

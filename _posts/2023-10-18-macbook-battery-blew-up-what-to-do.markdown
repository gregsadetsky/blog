**UPDATE**: Apple did right by my friend and offered to replace the laptop entirely.

All's well that ends well.

my friend's macbook's battery blew up. see below.

![macbook blew up](/assets/macbook-goes-boom/internals1.jpg)

using the serial number, I found out that it's a "MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)"

running the number on the [15-inch MacBook Pro Battery Recall Program
](https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall) page returns "The serial number you entered may be eligible for this program."

so... was this one of the very unlucky machines specifically targeted by the recall in which "the battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk" (as the recall page says)?

there are two things I'd love to see happen:
- it seems like the hard drive may be located by the speaker on the left -- my friend would want to recover her data. is that possible?
- it seems like Apple should be replacing the laptop since it officially recalled these specific devices for this specific problem. right?

thanks!

p.s. other photos below, including the power adapter which is 1) a real Apple charger (not a 3rd party one) 2) shows no sign of wear/exposed cables, etc.!

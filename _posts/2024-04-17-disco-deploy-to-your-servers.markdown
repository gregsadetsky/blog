My friend Antoine Leclair and I have been working on **[disco](https://letsdisco.dev/)**, an Open Source tool that lets you deploy web backend projects to your own servers. We're looking forward to having more people try it out!

I hope to write about it here as well in the near future. For now, here's a video of me using it to deploy a Flask + SQLite site to a cloud / virtual server on Hetzner.

[The documentation for disco is over here](https://docs.letsdisco.dev/). Reach out with any questions! [info@letsdisco.dev](mailto:info@letsdisco.dev)

it totally hit me as I was riding the train, so many friends are making so much cool shit that I gotta/need to do something about it

what am I gonna do about it? I'll blog about it! ok here goes, in no particular order, and I'm obviously forgetting 100 other cool friends doing shit that's just as cool.

IN NO ORDER PARTICULAR OR OTHERWISE:

(also I'm not going to write extremely flowery paragraphs about everyone below even though it's the most tempting -- just click all of the links and see for yourself)

- [Rafał](https://sonnet.io/) makes endless amounts of cool shit - and it's probably easiest to just subscribe [to his writings](https://untested.sonnet.io/)? it's so dense with good stuff.
- [Nolen](https://eieio.games/) also makes - do you get it now??? - so much cool stuff. they're mostly games? are they games? do you know? does he know? go play his games...? is [google calendar a game](https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-13-breaktime/)?
- [Brian](https://brianmoore.com/) makes, makes, makes, and them some. he just [published a captcha on McSweeney’s (??????)](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-millennial-captcha) and it's so incredibly good. so ridiculous. so talented. so silly. so beautiful.
- [Max](https://maxwellforbes.com/) launched [a game](https://talktomehuman.com/)? about ... it's ....?? you try to outsmart AIs?? by talking to them? with your voice? it's like reverse prompt engineering but your life is in (metaphorical, game) danger?? so original and good. so out there!
- [Zack](https://schollz.com/) is about to launch his [zeptocore](https://infinitedigits.co/wares/zeptocore/), an insanely small AND fun AND glitchy AND loopy sample ... destroyer? player? it's bananas. every [demo](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6Ogu5TvGq1/) is an extreme ode to the amen break (but you can also do other things like... """tunneling"""???)
- [Claire](https://www.clairetitelman.com/) leads extremely, very very heart+mind+soul expanding writing classes -- of which I probably took 6? in a row? - and is about to lead one IN PERSON in new york starting in like a week and yes, I'm freaking out. (and also going.) [register here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6KrYFrOFll/), don't even... think about it. yes, a writing class. yes, you. yes, you in a writing class, sharing, writing, crying, holding hands. you will ADORE it.

that's it. NOT THE END, NEVER. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

[https://eats.greg.technology/](https://eats.greg.technology/) is an absurd, small, nonsensical "site" -- a list of lists -- of maps of places where you can eat.

(((((it's also an iframed google docs)))))

right now it mostly covers New York, Montreal, and 2 cities in Japan.

but we're only getting started and the future of eats dot page is bright and who knows.

anyway, [go eats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-hS2r7v3Iw).

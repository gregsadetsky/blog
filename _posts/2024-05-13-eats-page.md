[https://eats.page/](https://eats.page/) is an absurd, small, nonsensical "site" -- a list of list -- of maps of places where you can eat.

(((((it's also an iframed google docs)))))

right now we mostly cover New York, Montreal, and 2 cities in Japan.

but we're only getting started and the future of eats dot page is bright and full of food.

anyway, [go eats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-hS2r7v3Iw).
